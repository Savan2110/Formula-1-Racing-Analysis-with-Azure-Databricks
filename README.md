<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
The project seeks to uncover interesting patterns and trends within historical Formula 1 data. These insights can shed light on driver performance consistency, team competitiveness across races, and factors influencing race outcomes.

<h3>Project Architecture</h3>
The project follows a structured data engineering pipeline with distinct stages:<br>
1.	Data Ingestion: Data is extracted from external sources and loaded into Azure Databricks for further processing.<br>
2.	Data Processing: The raw data undergoes cleaning and transformation steps. Apache Spark or SQL functionalities are employed as needed.<br>
3.	Exploratory Analysis: The cleaned and processed data is then subjected to exploratory analysis. This involves visualizations and statistical methods to identify trends and uncover meaningful insights.<br>

<h3>Data Source</h3>
The project can leverage various Formula 1 data sources. Public APIs are a readily available option, such as the Ergast Developer API (http://ergast.com/mrd/faq/comment-page-7/). Alternatively, the official Formula 1 website or other Formula 1 databases can be explored, considering data availability and licensing restrictions.

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>
•	Azure Databricks: Cloud-based platform for data processing and analytics.<br>
•	Apache Spark (Optional): Distributed processing engine for handling large datasets efficiently (used if data volume or processing complexity necessitates it).<br>
•	SQL: Used for querying and manipulating data within Azure Databricks.<br>
•	Programming Language (Choose One): Python, Scala, etc. - The specific language depends on user preference and compatibility with Spark.<br>

<h3>Project Flow/Data Pipeline</h3>
1.	Data Ingestion: Databricks notebooks or scripts are utilized to extract data from chosen sources. Existing projects on platforms like GitHub offer potential approaches and best practices for data extraction.<br>
2.	Data Processing: Spark or SQL functions are employed as needed to clean and transform the raw data. This stage might involve handling missing values, ensuring data consistency across formats, and potentially creating new derived features. Techniques used in existing projects on GitHub can be referenced for guidance on data cleaning and preparation.<br>
3.	Exploratory Analysis: The cleaned and processed data is employed for exploratory analysis. This involves applying visualization techniques and statistical methods to identify trends and uncover meaningful insights. Popular libraries like pandas and matplotlib in Python can be leveraged for creating informative visualizations. Findings from similar projects on GitHub can serve as a valuable starting point to guide the analysis process.
